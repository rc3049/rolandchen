            My practice begins with the everyday: a shared meal, a ritual, a screen. I find where self meets system, representation intersects with reality, and subsistence is performed. Baudrillard, Haraway, and Deleuze inform how I think about value, labor, survival, and the blurred line between nature and culture. I work with bodies—human, technological, and collective—to explore how identity is shaped through structures of relation. My work often takes the form of intervention—participatory, performative, and grounded in process.
